      <h1>DrupalGap Setup</h1>
      <h3>1. Enable Module</h3>
      <p><a href="http://drupal.org/project/services">Enable the Services module.</a></p>
      <p>Add a new endpoint and enable all resources</p>

      <h3>2. Edit services.js</h3>
      <p>Open js/services/services.js and configure your site_path and endpoint.</p>

      <h3>3. Enable <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/">CORS</a></h3>
      <p>Add this code to the end of settings.php.</p>
      <p>This will allow your app to connect to Drupal from any domain.</p>
      <pre>

if (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_ORIGIN'])){
  $origin = $_SERVER['HTTP_ORIGIN'];
  drupal_add_http_header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', $origin);
  drupal_add_http_header('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials', 'true');
  drupal_add_http_header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, PUT, POST, DELETE');
}
      </pre>

      <h3>4. Check out some examples</h3>
      <p>You will want to test these on a web server or from a hardware device.</p>
      <p>There are currently 3 examples to choose from.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <a href="examples/simple/index.html">Simple example</a> which has a bare minimum of markup and is meant to showcse the quickest way to get started.</li>
        <li>The <a href="examples/bootstrap/index.html">Twitter Bootstrap example</a> which has more markup but looks much nicer.</li>
        <li>The <a href="examples/jqm/index.html">jQuery Mobile example</a> which is ready to drop into PhoneGap.</li>
        <li>You can also read some <a href="jsdocs/index.html">documentation</a></li>.
      </ul>

      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <p>Eventually this project should accomplish a few things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide simple javascript api for working with Drupal services module</li>
        <li>Provide bare bones examples of how to connect to each service without anything extra, similar to the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/examples">examples module</a></li>
        <li>Provide a sample "app" with all those extras that aren't packaged into core</li>
        <!-- <li>Remove dependency on DrupalGap, but keeping it as an optional subcomponent</li> -->
      </ul>

      <h3>Current state</h3>
      <p>The master branch is fairly stable at the moment and probably will not change considerably in the future.</p>
      <p>Master should also be mostly compatible with any existing DrupalGap apps.</p>
      <p>I have moved my development to the <a href="https://github.com/cluke009/DrupalGap/tree/dev">dev branch</a> as I have some significant refactoring I would like to do.</p>
      <p>This branch will probably exist without working examples for some time. You will have to rely on jsdocs for help.</p>
